# ND035-P02-VehiclesAPI-Project

Project repository for JavaND Project 2, where students implement a Vehicles API using Java and Spring Boot that can communicate with separate location and pricing services.

## Instructions

Check each component to see its details and instructions. Note that all three applications
should be running at once for full operation. Further instructions are available in the classroom.  

# Boogle Maps
You'll find the code related to our location service in the boogle-maps folder.   
It serves as a Mock to simulate a Maps WebService where, given a latitude and longitude, will return a random address.
